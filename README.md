 üëã **Hi, I‚Äôm Chidiere**
 
  üå± I am a second-year undergraduate at De Montfort University, currently on my path to being a proficient full stack developer.

 I have an immense passion for developing technical solutions to business problems, which is represented in several personal projects. I have also developed a strong passion for sustainable, assistive and autonomous software during my budding career in computing, allowing me to dive, even more, into the opportunities that lie therein.
 
 I am currently undergoing lots of research, while working on something revolutionary, dare I say, and I look forward to seeing how much I can evolve in my field!
